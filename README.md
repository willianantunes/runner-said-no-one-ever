# Runner [#SaidNoOneEver](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SaidNoOneEver?src=hashtag_click)

Find a movie or a character from it and this API will reply to you as soon as possible #SaidNoOneEver.

## Running it

Run NOW through the command:

    docker run --rm --name runner-said-no-one-ever \
    -e PUMA_BIND_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0 \
    -e PUMA_BIND_PORT=8080 \
    -e PUMA_MIN_THREADS=4 \
    -e PUMA_MAX_THREADS=20 \
    -e PUMA_NUMBER_OF_WORKERS=0 \
    -e PUMA_PERSISTENT_TIMEOUT=20 \
    -e PUMA_FIRST_DATA_TIMEOUT=30 \
    -p 8000:8080 \
    willianantunes/runner-said-no-one-ever

If you download the project just issue:

    docker-compose up app

And with `HTTPie`:

    http GET :8000/api/v1/deckard-cain name==Cockatiel
    http GET :8000/api/v1/movies

## Running all tests

Execute the following command:

    docker-compose up tests

And you'll see something like:

```
Finished in 0.96628 seconds (files took 0.43692 seconds to load)
5 examples, 0 failures
```

## Purpose

The idea here is to delay 1 second or more (given you custom configuration) to answer a request, thus you can use this behavior for interesting tests, like dispatching 10 requests from you back-end to this service and do it efficiently with some approaches like through [Threads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)#Thread_and_fiber_issues) or [Coroutines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine).

Why Sinatra? See more [here](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/web_app_frameworks). 

## Lessons learned

In order to create a project following Ruby conventions to organize a project, I executed the following command:

    bundle gem runner_said_no_one_ever --no-exe --no-coc --mit --test=rspec

After that, I deleted the following files:

```txt
runner_said_no_one_ever.gemspec
.travis.yml
bin
```
